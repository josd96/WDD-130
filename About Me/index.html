    <p>Hello everyone! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am married to my amazing wife, we are still within our first year of marriage! I am from the Dominican Republic. I have been able to visit many different countties and nothing compares to living in a tropical island. I love swimming, music, and learning about science and technology.</p>
    <p>I am about to start working in a nearby hospital assisting doctors in the histology department. I recently finished a BS degree in Biochemistry and for the moment I am gaining more experience and knowledge before I go to graduate school.</p>
    <p>I was introduced to web development when I was in high school but I have forgotten most of it. I decided to pursue an Associates degree in Software Developtment because I want to use this knowledge in future biochemistry projects.</p>
